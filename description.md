We are working on a biologically inspired robotics project that mimics the behavior of fish. Our experiment involves a tank divided into two identical chambers. Each chamber can randomly contain a marker that indicates the presence of food. We observed that the fish successfully associated the marker with the food source about 80% of the time. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that fish, with their relatively simple brains, rely more on basic visual cues rather than remembering complex geometrical patterns to locate food.
