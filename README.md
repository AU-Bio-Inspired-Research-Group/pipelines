Pipeline 1. 

Arguments provided: method (e.g., MAE), x + y dimensions (e.g., 4 , 4) 
Output: Colour map for 'full resolution" images and "reduced 'x','y' resolution" images normalised between 0 and1. Statistics for colourmap: mean, std dev, median, min, max, % of values below 0.01. Histograms for each colourmap showing value distribution.

Pipeline 2.

Arguments provided: Either area of interest or grid resolution
Output: Colour map for the area of interest showing familiarity between a and b normalised between 0 and 1 with stats + histogram of values. For large grid resolutions just display mean and std deviation for each block plus % of values under 0.01.
